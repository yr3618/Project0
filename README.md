Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


Hi! Welcome to my website.
To do it, I have simply tried to reproduce the website I had to make for a group project (using Wordpress).
First, open index.html. It is the home page of my website. There, I present the four other pages of the website+ you can see an image there. As it is as percentage, it changes as the window size changes.

You can see that the sentence: "Maroc végétal, l'essence pour les sens" is using a css stylesheet where there is a SCSS variable: $color logo. it appears in every page of the website;

From each page, you can access every other page of the website:
In our products.html: i have taken adventage of bootstrap grid model. In the end, with the new prodcts section, you can see that I used SCSS inheritance
In contact.html, I used button component of bootstrap so the user can rate our website. I have also created a form so the user can comment.
In Morocco.html, I have created a table. I have also use the @media function to make the image disappear for smaller windows.
In methods.html, I have an unordered list. There, I have use nesting.

In all these pages, I have used a varitery of CSS properties and selectors.
